# Scratch Curriculum (12 Weeks)

## Week 1: Introduction to Scratch

**Definition:** Learn what Scratch is, how the interface works, and how
sprites and stages function.\
**Examples:**\
- Move 10 steps\
- Say "Hello!" for 2 seconds\
- Change backdrop to "Blue Sky"\
- Turn 15 degrees

## Week 2: Motion & Looks

**Definition:** Understand how sprites move, look, and animate on the
stage.\
**Examples:**\
- Glide 1 sec to x:100 y:50\
- Switch costume\
- Turn 15 degrees\
- Point in direction 90

## Week 3: Events & Control

**Definition:** Trigger actions using events and add control loops to
repeat actions.\
**Examples:**\
- When key pressed\
- Repeat 10\
- Forever loop\
- When sprite clicked

## Week 4: Conditionals

**Definition:** Use if/else blocks to make decisions in your code.\
**Examples:**\
- If touching color\
- If touching sprite\
- Else say "No"\
- If key pressed then move

## Week 5: Variables

**Definition:** Store values such as score, time, or speed.\
**Examples:**\
- Set score to 0\
- Change score by 1\
- Show variable\
- Set timer to 10

## Week 6: Operators

**Definition:** Use math, comparison, and random values to make code
smarter.\
**Examples:**\
- Pick random 1 to 10\
- Score \> 5\
- Join 'Hello' 'World'\
- (x + y) \* 2

## Week 7: Loops + Logic

**Definition:** Combine loops and conditionals to build interactive
gameplay.\
**Examples:**\
- Forever if touching\
- Repeat until touching edge\
- Change y by -5\
- If score \> 10 then say "Level Up!"

## Week 8: My Blocks

**Definition:** Create your own custom blocks to organize your code.\
**Examples:**\
- Define jump\
- Define wave\
- Call custom block\
- Add input to custom block

## Week 9: Broadcasting

**Definition:** Send messages between sprites to control scenes and
interactions.\
**Examples:**\
- Broadcast start\
- When I receive go\
- Broadcast and wait\
- Scene change on broadcast

## Week 10: Cloning

**Definition:** Create and control duplicate sprites (clones) in your
projects.\
**Examples:**\
- Create clone of myself\
- When start as clone\
- Delete clone\
- Clone falls from top

## Week 11: Full Game Logic

**Definition:** Build complete games using all Scratch concepts learned
so far.\
**Examples:**\
- Add lives system\
- Increase difficulty\
- Collision scoring\
- Reset game when lives = 0

## Week 12: Final Project

**Definition:** Create your own Scratch game or story using everything
learned.\
**Options:**\
- Platformer\
- Maze\
- Clicker\
- Story animation
